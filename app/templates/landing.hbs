<div class="message">
  <p>Basically a site which lets you organise the videos your YouTube subscriptions upload.</p>
  <p>Kind of like the built in "Watch Later" playlist on YouTube, but much nicer to use.</p>
  <p>You have to sign in with the Google account you use for YouTube by clicking the button in the top right.</p>
